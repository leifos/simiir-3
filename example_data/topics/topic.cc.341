Airport Security 

A relevant document would discuss the effectiveness of efforts to better scrutinize passengers and luggage on all flights, but particularly international flights.  

A relevant document would contain reports on what steps airports worldwide have taken to better scrutinize passengers and their luggage on domestic and international flights and to step up screening of all carry-on baggage. With increased concerns about terrorism, articles on airport security relating in particular to additional steps taken by airports to increase flight safety would be relevant. The mere mention of enhanced security does not constitute relevance. Additional steps refer to something beyond just passenger and carry-on screening using the normal methods. Examples of new steps would be additional personnel, automated screening processes, sophisticated monitoring and screening devices, whole body imaging techniques, and extraordinary measures to screen luggage in the baggage compartment.
